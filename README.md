# ⭐ Star Detection In Ancient Coins. ⭐
Detecting whether an ancient coin of Alexander Jannaeus (76-104 bc) is imprinted with eight or six rays, using deep learning. <br>

Seeing how many rays there are seems simple to the naked eye. <br>

However, there could be a damaged coin <br>

Furthermore, this is the size of the data-set part of six rays. <br>

The rest (around 300) are eight rays. <br>
To tackle this problem, we have automated the model generation, producing 20 to 30 models (after heavy filtering) and predicting by majority vote. <br>
##TODO:
- [ ] software example
- [ ] maybe methodology brief
